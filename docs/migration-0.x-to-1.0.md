# Migration Guide: 0.x to 1.0

_Status: 1.0.0_

PRTS-MCP 1.0 keeps the public MCP tool surface stable while normalizing the internal data layer.

## What Stays Compatible

- Existing MCP tool names are unchanged.
- Existing required tool parameters are unchanged.
- `GAMEDATA_PATH` still disables GameData auto-sync and points to an
  ArknightsGameData-compatible root.
- `STORYJSON_PATH` still disables story auto-sync and points to `zh_CN.zip`.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_MIRRORS` keep the same runtime meanings.
- Docker and npm releases continue to include bundled fallback data prepared by
  CI.
- PyPI remains data-light and relies on startup auto-sync or user-provided data
  paths.

## Internal Changes

- Operator and story parsers now read through a small store abstraction.
- Directory-backed, zip-backed, and fallback stores share the same conceptual
  API across Python and TypeScript.
- Runtime sync code is being consolidated around dataset specs for:
  - `gamedata.excel`
  - `story.zh_CN`

These changes should not require client configuration changes.

## Behavioral Changes from 0.x

- **GameData sync now uses Release archives.** 0.x downloaded individual raw
  JSON files from the GitHub raw content API. 1.0 downloads `zh_CN-excel.zip`
  from GitHub Releases and extracts it into the gamedata directory. The
  on-disk layout is the same — existing `GAMEDATA_PATH` mounts continue to
  work.
- **Cache metadata moved to `archives/`.** The sync cache file is now
  `archives/release_meta.json` instead of the old root-level
  `cache_meta.json`. Old cache files are harmless but will be ignored; the
  server will re-sync on first startup.
- **`local_repo.jsonc` is removed.** If you were using `local_repo.jsonc` to
  point to a local ArknightsGameData checkout, set `GAMEDATA_PATH` instead.
- **Story data requires `zh_CN.zip`.** `STORYJSON_PATH` must point directly
  to the zip file (not a directory). This was already the case in 0.x story
  releases; the migration just makes it explicit.
- **`story_review_table.json` is now a required gamedata file.** The gamedata
  completeness check now requires this file in addition to
  `character_table.json`, `handbook_info_table.json`, and
  `charword_table.json`. If your custom gamedata directory is missing this
  file, operator tools will report data as unavailable.

## Upgrade Notes

1. Upgrade the Python package or TypeScript package as usual.
2. Keep existing `GAMEDATA_PATH`, `STORYJSON_PATH`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and
   `GITHUB_MIRRORS` settings if you already use them.
3. For Docker deployments, keep mounting `gamedata` and `storyjson` volumes as
   before.
4. If you publish local npm tarballs manually, prewarm `ts/data/` first or
   expect only placeholder fallback data in the tarball.

## Deferred

Story summary tools are not part of the initial 1.0 migration. They may be considered after the reader layer is stable.
